      David's vivid imagination and his inquisitive and inventive mind suggest a high IQ.
      If Iraq was equipped to invade and conquer Tel Aviv, the U.S. may have quashed
      that pervasively.
      We've never quantitatively proven that a quaver is equivalent to a quiver, only
      qualitatively.
      This revolutionary cardiovascular technique is representative of the
      productivity here in Charlottesville.
      "I've never had such quality hors d'oeuvres," Javier said assertively over the
      tranquil sounds of Vivaldi, as he looked over the picturesque headquarters of
      the Vancouver Civic Center.
      Nirvana's inequivalent sequel to their provocative release, Nevermind, is
      inconclusive.  Nevertheless, this quirky yet vivacious trio has evoked a
      progressive sound that very well may give you a new perspective on irreverence.

      Zachary MacKenzie froze in amazement; on the radio in his Mazda he heard
      pizzicato stanzas of Mozart.
      Carmen Rodriguez is a citizen of Venezuela; her former spouse, Inigo Martinez,
      and his new wife, Anna Vasquez, have moved to Swaziland or Tanzania.
      A crazed gazelle was whizzing around the zoo; a quizzical giraffe guzzled down
      pizzas through his muzzle; another one merely grazed and dozed; several
      chimpanzees started zigging and zagging; the reptile zone was oozing with
      activity; several lizards hazarded the freezing waters and capsized the fish
      tanks; a dozen grizzlies were waltzing in the plaza.

      Heathcliff Huxtable was played by the inexorable Bill Cosby.
      An inexhaustible supply of benzedrine merely exacerbated his disturbances.
      Bruce Boxleitner explained to the extraterrestrial why Babylon Five was built.
      The ambidextrous exhibitor was exhausted by the time he loaded the boxcar
      with hobbyhorses.
      Drop those xeroxes off in the mailbox; I'll get them in the bibliography in
      five days maximum.
      Mr. Balboa is pretty flexible with the textbook; it's probably excusable to
      fall a bit behind.
      Why Mr. Baxter went from Bordeaux to the tableaux exhibit in Luxembourg by
      taxicab is inexplicable.
      Becky found the Bronx pretty obnoxious; though there was that Caribbean
      restaurant that truly excelled.
      The executives at NBC, CBS, and ABC all found it inexcusable that the BBC was
      so inflexible and xenophobic.
      An exuberant Bill Clinton blew into his saxophone before the ambassadors; it
      was an extraordinary experience that nobody could explain.
